# CNC-MODEL
The extruder will be an pnuematic system, that's not designed yet.

There is a new design. It's still rough but it's much cleaner and probably sturdier. I also took the time to more accurately model some of the parts so we can have more accurate pictures. I'm currently working on the timing pulley axel system. There is still a lot of work to be done.
