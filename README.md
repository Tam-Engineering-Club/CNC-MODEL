The extruder will be an pnuematic system, that's not designed yet.

The tightening system for the belt is going to be changed to something a bit sturdier. I might make some sort of way to integrate the motor into the T-Block replacement. Once we get the frame bars, I will come up with a way to atatch these blocks to the frame.
